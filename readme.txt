An events management plugin specifically designed for classical musicians.

== Description ==

ConcertPress is designed from the ground up for classical musicians.

ConcertPress saves venues and programmes for you so that they can easily be selected again.

Programmes and venues can be added seperately or as you add an event. Events can also be copied which is handy when you're adding lots of dates for a tour or a run of performances.

Past events are stored in an archive.

If you're a classical musician, this is the events plugin for you!


== Installation ==

1. Upload the ConcertPress folder to the plugins directory in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin (don't be scared!)
3. Add loads of events
4. Enjoy
